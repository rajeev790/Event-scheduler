# Task 2: Event Scheduler

## Overview
A full-stack application to manage a daily event scheduler using Node.js, Express, and Angular. Non-overlapping event logic is enforced, and events are listed on a timeline.

## Thought Process
- **Backend**: Created a `Scheduler` class to manage non-overlapping events and API endpoints using Express.
- **Frontend**: Built an Angular app to add events and display them on a list.

## Setup

1. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   node app.js
